Manage your to-do list from your mobile phone.

Managing your tasks should be easy, that's why "To Do List Manager" is here:

You assign your "priorities" and set the following:
    - Name.
    - Choose the order of your "priorities".
    - Delete when your priorities change.

Each "task" you create is tailored to different needs, and its flexibility allows you to:
    - Assign and change the name.
    - Describe the task.
    - Choose in which priority to assign it (for example, "Important", "normal", "for tomorrow", "pending movies", etc. you edit it to your liking).
    - Shows the creation and completion dates of the task.

When the tasks are completed you will be able to see them in the history and if you decide to delete that task that you did not like to do, you can delete it forever without leaving a trace.
